<title>
Mobile terminal providing face recognition using glance sensor
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a mobile terminal. The mobile terminal may include a front camera obtaining a 2D face image of a user, a glance sensor tilted by a certain angle and disposed adjacent to the front camera to obtain metadata of the 2D face image, and a controller obtaining a distance between the glance sensor and the front camera, the distance enabling an area of an overlap region, where a first region representing a range photographable by the front camera overlaps a second region representing a range photographable by the glance sensor, to be the maximum.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A mobile terminal comprising: a front camera configured to obtain a two-dimensional (2D) face image of a user; a glance sensor tilted by a certain angle and disposed adjacent to the front camera to obtain metadata of the 2D face image; and a controller obtaining a distance between the glance sensor and the front camera, the distance enabling an area of an overlap region, where a first region representing a range photographable by the front camera overlaps a second region representing a range photographable by the glance sensor, to be the maximum.
2. The mobile terminal of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to obtain the distance, enabling the area of the overlap region to be the maximum, between the glance sensor and the front camera by varying a tilting angle of the glance sensor.
3. The mobile terminal of claim 2, wherein the controller is configured to set the distance, enabling the area of the overlap region to be the maximum, between the glance sensor and the front camera and the tilting angle of the glance sensor as an optimal disposition location of the glance sensor.
4. The mobile terminal of claim 3, wherein the controller is configured to set a disposition location of the front camera as an original point and calculates coordinates of a first triangle representing the first region, based on a field of view of the front camera and a maximum photographing distance of the front camera.
5. The mobile terminal of claim 4, wherein the controller is configured to calculate coordinates of a second triangle representing the second region, based on a field of view of the glance sensor, a maximum photographing distance of the glance sensor, a distance between the front camera and the glance sensor, and a tilting angle of the glance sensor.
6. The mobile terminal of claim 5, wherein before the glance sensor is tilted, the controller is configured to calculate coordinates of a third triangle representing a third region photographable by the glance sensor, and the controller is configured to rotation-convert the coordinates of the third triangle, based on the tilting angle of the glance sensor and calculate the coordinates of the second triangle.
7. The mobile terminal of claim 6, wherein the controller is configured to calculate coordinates of the overlap region, based on the coordinates of the first triangle and the coordinates of the second triangle and calculates the area of the overlap region, based on the coordinates of the overlap region.
8. The mobile terminal of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to generate three-dimensional (3D) face information, based on the 2D face image obtained by the front camera and metadata obtained by the glance sensor.
9. The mobile terminal of claim 8, wherein the metadata comprises one or more of an angle of a face of the user, a size of the face, and a location of the face.
10. The mobile terminal of claim 9, wherein the angle of the face comprises an angle by which the face is rotated about one or more of a pitch axis, a roll axis, and a yaw axis.
11. The mobile terminal of claim 8, further comprising a memory storing the generated 3D face information, wherein the controller is configured to performs a user authentication process by comparing the stored 3D face information with 3D face information obtained for user authentication.
12. The mobile terminal of claim 1, wherein the glance sensor is controlled to be permanently activated with a low power to obtain a front image and metadata of the front image.
13. The mobile terminal of claim 1, wherein the front camera and the glance sensor are disposed on the same line in an upper end of the mobile terminal.
14. The mobile terminal of claim 1, wherein the glance sensor is tilted in one direction of an up direction, a down direction, a left direction, and a right direction.
15. The mobile terminal of claim 1, wherein the metadata is data which is changed when the mobile terminal is tilted by an external physical force.
