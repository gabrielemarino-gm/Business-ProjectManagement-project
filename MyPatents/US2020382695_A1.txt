ROBOT AND ELECTRONIC DEVICE FOR ACQUIRING VIDEO, AND METHOD FOR ACQUIRING VIDEO USING ROBOT
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein is a robot and an electronic device for acquiring video, and a method for acquiring video using the robot. The robot includes a camera configured to rotate in the lateral direction and tilt in the vertical direction, and controls at least one of a direction of the rotation of the camera, an angle of the tilt of the camera, and a focal distance of the camera by recognizing and tracking users in a video acquired by the camera.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A robot, comprising: a body configured to rotate and to tilt; a camera coupled to the body and configured to rotate and tilt according to the rotate and the tilt of the body, wherein the camera is configured to acquire a video of a space; a face recognition unit configured to recognize respective faces of one or more persons in the video; a tracking unit configured to track motion of each of the recognized faces of the one or more persons; and a controller configured to: calculate a respective size of each of the faces of the one or more persons; select a first person, from among the one or more persons, based on the calculated sizes of the faces; and control at least one of a direction of the rotation of the camera, an angle of the tilt of the camera and a focal distance of the camera, based on the tracked motion of the recognized face of the first person.
2. The robot of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to: control the direction of the rotation of the camera and the angle of the tilt of the camera to achieve an particular orientation of the camera relative to the face of the first person; and control a focal distance of the camera by comparing respective sizes of the face of the first person before and after motion of the first person.
3. The robot of claim 2, wherein the particular orientation occurs when the camera faces a general direction of the face of the first person.
4. The robot of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to: normalize sizes of the faces of the one or more persons based on an interocular distance; and select the first person based on the normalized sizes of the faces of the one or more persons.
5. The robot of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to: select a person having a largest face size, from among the one or more persons, as the first person.
6. The robot of claim 1, further comprising: a microphone configured to receive a spoken audio that is present in the space; wherein the controller is further configured to select the first person further based on the received spoken audio.
7. The robot of claim 6, wherein the controller is further configured to: control gain of the microphone by comparing respective sizes of the face of the first person before and after motion of the first person.
8. The robot of claim 6, wherein the controller is configured to: calculate a position from which the spoken audio is provided; and select the first person further based on whether the one or more persons are in the position from which the voice signal is provided.
9. The robot of claim 8, wherein the controller is configured to: select a second person as the first person, from among the one or more persons, when the second person is located in the position from which the spoken audio is provided.
10. The robot of claim 8, wherein the controller is configured to: select a second person having a largest face size as the first person, from among the one or more persons, when none of the one or more persons is located in the position from which the spoken audio is provided.
11. The robot of claim 8, wherein the controller is configured to: select a second person having a largest face size as the first person, from among the one or more persons, when a plurality of persons from among the one or more persons are located in the position from which the spoken audio is provided.
12. The robot of claim 1, further comprising: a speaker, wherein the controller is configured to: control volume of the speaker by comparing respective sizes of the face of the first person before and after motion of the first person.
13. The robot of claim 1, wherein the body is further configured to rotate in a lateral direction, and to tilt in an vertical direction.
14. An electronic device, comprising: a camera coupled to the body and configured to rotate and to tilt, wherein the camera is configured to acquire a video of a space within which one or more persons are positioned; and a processor configured to: recognize respective faces of the one or more persons in the video; track motion of each of the recognized faces of the one or more persons; calculate a respective size of each of the faces of the one or more persons; select a first person, from among the one or more persons, based on the calculated sizes of the faces; and control at least one of a direction of the rotation of the camera, an angle of the tilt of the camera and a focal distance of the camera, based on the tracked motion of the recognized face of the first person.
15. A method, comprising: acquiring, by a camera, a video of a space within which one or more persons are positioned; recognizing respective faces of the one or more persons in the video; tracking motion of each of the recognized faces of the one or more persons; calculating a respective size of each of the faces of the one or more persons; selecting a first person, from among the one or more persons, based on the calculated sizes of the faces; and controlling at least one of a direction of rotation of the camera, an angle of tilt of the camera and a focal distance of the camera, based on the tracked motion of the recognized face of the first person.
