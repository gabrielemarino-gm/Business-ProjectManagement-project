<title>
Long-tail large scale face recognition by non-linear feature level domain adaptation
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method, system, and computer program product are provided for facial recognition. The method includes receiving, by a processor device, a plurality of images. The method also includes extracting, by the processor device with a feature extractor utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) with an enlarged intra-class variance of long-tail classes, feature vectors for each of the plurality of images. The method additionally includes generating, by the processor device with a feature generator, discriminative feature vectors for each of the feature vectors. The method further includes classifying, by the processor device utilizing a fully connected classifier, an identity from the discriminative feature vector. The method also includes control an operation of a processor-based machine to react in accordance with the identity.
